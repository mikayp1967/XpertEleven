# X11 CR calculator

## Original version

The original version of this is just js that is embedded in a blogger.com blog page. It's super ropey on account of I dunno how to code javascript and now it's broken.


## New version

Updated the code to remove tinymce and do interaction and reading from the textarea/div natively.

The code is legit nasty, apologies. I think most the old stuff was chopping strings up the way I would with bash and regexing what I don't want. The updates have some of that and some bits that pick out cells the way js should, but working within a framework of I dunno how to do it. Still I got it done.

I added some debug into a debug box too. If I get any issues that will get extended in areas bugs are found.
